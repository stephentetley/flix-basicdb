# flix-basicdb

A basic monadic database interface for Flix using JDBC.

Note:

To run the tests or programs depending on this library you are likely to 
have to use the classpath option to tell java where to find to the JDBC driver.

In the command below `sqlite-jdbc-3.36.n.n.jar` is in the folder `lib`:

> java -cp "./lib/*;../bin/flix.jar" ca.uwaterloo.flix.Main test
